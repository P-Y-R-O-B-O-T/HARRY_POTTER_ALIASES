Aberto
    Description: A spell used to open doors; it is probably related to Alohamora.[1]


Accio (Summoning Charm)
Description: Summons an object towards the caster. It is able to summon objects in direct line of sight of the caster, as well as things out of view, by calling the object aloud after the incantation (unless the spell is casted nonverbally). This spell needs thought behind it, and the object must be clear in the caster's mind before trying to summon it.[2] The caster doesn't necessarily need to know the location of the target as long as they say the name of the object to be summoned, such as when Hermione Granger summoned some books from Dumbledore's office simply by saying "Accio Horcrux books!" while in Gryffindor Tower.

    Description: Spell used as part of the process of becoming an Animagus. The incantation has to be recited at sunrise and sundown, every day before the consumption of the Animagus Potion.

Crucio (Cruciatus Curse)

    Description: Inflicts intense, excruciating physical pain on the recipient of the curse, and will result in insanity if exposed to it for too long. The pain is described as worse than having "white-hot knives" being driven into the victim. It cannot be performed successfully by a person who is doing so out of pure spite or anger; one must feel a true, deep desire to cause the victim pain and take great pleasure in their suffering. If one casts this spell on another fellow human being or living creature, he or she will receive a life sentence in Azkaban prison for it, as with the other two Unforgivable Curses.[13]

(Horcrux-making spell)
Horcruxes
    Description: This spell allows a part of a wizard's soul to pass into an object, thereby making the object a Horcrux. One has to commit murder and take advantage of the soul's "splitting apart" by this supreme act of evil in order to be able to perform this spell, and it is probably very complex. In 1943, Horace Slughorn described the spell to a young Tom Riddle as encasing a portion of the torn soul and placing it within an object. The spell itself is described in detail in a banned book known as "Secret of the Darkest Art", which Hermione Granger summoned from Albus Dumbledore's office near the end of their sixth year. According to the text, use of this spell to separate the soul will make the remaining portion of the soul very fragile, and can only be reversed by "remorse" of the wrongs the creator had made; however, the pain caused by attempting to reverse the creation of a Horcrux can destroy the individual.

Illegibilus
    Description: Makes writing impossible to read.

    Type: Curse
    Pronunciation: im-PEER-ee-oh
    Description: Places the victim completely under the caster's control. The victim is put into a calm, trance-like state, and becomes unquestionably obedient to the commands of the caster. However, those who are strong-willed may learn to resist it. One of the three "Unforgivable Curses," the use of this curse on another human results in capital punishment or life sentence in Azkaban.[13]
    Seen/Mentioned: Used on many occasions. First seen in 1994 when Barty Crouch Jnr, impersonating ex-Auror Alastor Moody, used it on a spider and later on students during a "class demonstration" in a Defence Against the Dark Arts class. While breaking into Gringotts in 1998, Harry used it on a goblin and a Death Eater when they became suspicious.
    Etymology: Latin impero, I command, and English "imperious".

(Imperturbable Charm)

    Type: Charm
    Description: Creates an invisible magical barrier on an object, such as a door. This barrier bounces objects off of it, and muffles sounds.
    Seen/Mentioned: It used by Molly Weasley in the same year on the door of the room in which an Order of the Phoenix meeting was being held, in order to prevent her sons, Fred and George, from eavesdropping.[53]

Impervius (Impervius Charm)

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: im-PUR-vee-us
    Description: Makes an object repel water and mist.
    Seen/Mentioned: Used by Hermione Granger in 1993 on Harry's glasses while in a Quidditch match and also by the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Also used in 1997, first by Ron to protect objects in Yaxley's office from rain, and then by Hermione to protect Harry, Ron and Griphook from the burning treasure in the Lestranges' vault.
    Etymology: It is said that the Latin impervius means (and is the source of) "impervious"; although it is the source of the word, it is better translated as impassable, as in a mountain peak.

    Type: Transfiguration
    Pronunciation: in-an-ih-MAH-tus CON-jur-us
    Description: It is a spell of unknown effect, most likely used to conjure an inanimate object.

    Pronunciation: in-KAR-ser-us
    Description: Ties up the target with ropes conjured from thin air.
    Seen/Mentioned: Used 1996, when Dolores Umbridge tries to hold off Centaurs. Also used by Harry on the Inferi in Voldemort's Crystal Cave in 1997 and also attempted to use it on Severus Snape in the same year.
    Etymology: Probably English incarcerate, "to imprison". Possibly linked to the Latin in carcerem, "in(to) prison".
    Notes: A non-verbal version of this spell may have been used to tie up Remus Lupin by Severus Snape during the encounter in the Shrieking Shack, and then later Peter Pettigrew in 1994. It may also have been used by Quirrell in 1992, although he is said to have merely "snapped his fingers". Also, it may have been the spell Antonin Dolohov used non-verbally to bind Ron Weasley with "shining black ropes" in a skirmish on Tottenham Court Road.

Incendio (Fire-Making Spell)
IncendioHM

    Type: Charm, Conjuration
    Pronunciation: in-SEN-dee-oh
    Description: Produces fire.
    Seen/Mentioned: It was used in 1994 by Arthur Weasley to create a fire in the Dursleys' hearth so that he could use Floo Powder there.[54]
    Etymology: Latin incendere, "to set fire (to)". Note that the first principal part of this verb (meaning "I set fire") is incendo, not incendio; the incantation does not match exactly any correct conjugation of the verb. Incêndio, in Portuguese (same pronunciation as in English) means 'huge fire'. "Encender" in Spanish means "to ignite" and "Incendie" in French means flame. (A plausible but less likely source might be that it is a back-formation from the English word "incendiary," i.e., "causing fire.")

Incendio Duo

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: in-SEN-dee-oh DOO-oh
    Description: A stronger version of Incendio.

Incendio Tria

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: in-SEN-dee-oh TREE-ah
    Description: An improvement over both Incendio and Incendio Duo.

Inflatus
Sister

    Type: Jinx

    Etymology: The prefix 'Inflate' derives from the English verb "to expand with oxygen".

    Description: Informous is a spell that is used to complete one's Folio Bruti. A page with a brief description (including weaknesses and strengths) of the charmed creature is added to the caster's Folio Bruti.
    Etymology: The prefix Info derives from the English verb "to inform".

(Instant scalping hex)

    Type: Hex
    Description: Instantly scalps all the hair off of a target.
    Seen/Mentioned: Harry Potter came across it while browsing the index of Basic Hexes for the Busy and Vexed, trying to find a way to fight the dragon he knew he would have to face for the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament. He quickly decided it would be ineffective, because dragons do not have hair.
    Notes: This spell has similar effects to the Hair Loss Curse.

(Intruder Charm)

    Type: Charm
    Description: Detects intruders and sounds an alarm.
    Seen/Mentioned: Horace Slughorn used it on a Muggle-owned house he stayed in temporarily in 1996, but did not hear it go off when Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter arrived, as he was in the bath.

    Seen/Mentioned: One of the spells mentioned in Curses and Counter-Curses by Vindictus Viridian, used on Harry, practising for the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament, by Hermione. Also, Draco Malfoy was hit with this jinx (along with another one) at the end of the term.

(Jelly-Brain Jinx)

    Type: Jinx
    Description: Reduces the target's mental processes.
    Seen/Mentioned: During the September 1999 riot that took place during the Puddlemere United/Holyhead Harpies Quidditch game, a lot of Harpy supporters were using this jinx.
    Notes: This spell may have been the spell that the Death Eaters hit Ron with in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.

(Jelly-Fingers Curse)

    Type: Curse
    Description: Causes target's fingers to become wobbly, making it uneasy for the victim to grasp objects.
    Seen/Mentioned: After a June 1999 Pride of Portree/Appleby Arrows Quidditch game, the losing Seeker accused his opposite number of putting this curse on him as they both closed in on the Snitch.

(Knee-reversal hex)
KneeReversal

    Type: Hex
    Description: Puts knees on backward.[16]
    Seen/mentioned: In Quidditch Through the Ages, Gertie Keddle uses this hex when a man playing an early form of Quidditch comes to retrieve his ball from her garden.

Legilimency

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: Le-JIL-ih-mens
    Description: Allows the caster to delve into the mind of the victim, allowing the caster to see the memories, thoughts, and emotions of the victim.
    Seen/Mentioned: Used by Severus Snape on Harry after he had a dream about Arthur Weasley being attacked by Nagini in 1995. Also during Occlumency lessons in 1996. Also used non-verbally by Snape on Harry in 1997 to allow him to see where Harry had learned the Sectumsempra spell.

    Description: Hoists people up into the air by their ankle.[56] Created by Severus Snape.[5]
    Seen/Mentioned: Apparently invented by the Half-Blood Prince; it is a non-verbal-only spell (although it is whispered by Hermione in 1997). Harry Potter learnt it by reading the notes written by the Half-Blood Prince. He used it on Ron. The previous year, Harry had seen (through the Pensieve used by Severus Snape) his father, James Potter, use the spell against Professor Snape.
    Etymology: Latin levare, "raise" and corpus, "body" or "corpse".

Liberacorpus

    Description: The counter-jinx to Levicorpus.[56]
    Seen/Mentioned: Harry used the spell in 1996 to counteract Levicorpus he had inadvertently cast on Ron.[56]
    Etymology: Latin liberare, "to free", and corpus, "body" or "corpse".
    Notes: It is not clear why Levicorpus has a specific counter-spell, and is not neutralised by simply using Finite Incantatem, although this could be due to the fact that Snape invented the spell and therefore made it irreversible except by its specific counter-curse.

Locomotor (Locomotion Charm)

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: loh-kuh-MOH-tor
    Description: Allows a witch or wizard to levitate a target a few inches off of the ground and then move said object in any given direction. Similarly to the Summoning Charm, a specific object can be moved by calling the object aloud after saying the incantation.
    Seen/Mentioned: Used by Nymphadora Tonks in Harry Potter to move Harry's trunk from his room. Filius Flitwick similarly used it to move Sybill Trelawney's trunk after Dolores Umbridge sacked her.

    Etymology: English locomotion, "movement" + Latin mortis, "of death".
    Notes: It is unclear whether or how this spell is related to the Locomotor spell. It could, however, be that the curse "locks" any part of the body in accordance to where it is pointed, or moves the body into a position of the caster's choosing whilst placing them into an immobile state. It is possible that Draco had pointed his wand at Neville and the curse "locked" his legs together.

Lumos (Wand-Lighting Charm)
Wand-lighting charm

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: LOO-mos
    Description: Illuminates the tip of the caster's wand, allowing the caster to see in the dark.

    Pronunciation: LOO-mos DOO-oh
    Description: Creates a focused beam of light from the end of the wand. It is a variant of the Wand-Lighting Charm.

    Seen/Mentioned: Used by Hermione to free Ron from the Devil's Snare. The incantation was only used in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.
    Etymology: Derived from two words; the Latin lumen, meaning "light", and the Latin word for "sun", which in its accusative case is "solem".
    Notes: It is possible that the quality of the light is on the warmer solar end of the spectrum; Considering the known uses that the spell has been put to, it isn't that much of a stretch to presume that the spell is used to conjure Sunlight.


Magicus Extremos

    Type: Charm
    Description: Partnership-based charm that temporarily increases the casters' spell power.

Melofors (Melofors Jinx)
MeloforsPOA

    Etymology: Latin mobilis, "movable" or "flexible", and arbor (alternatively arbos), "tree".

    Etymology: Latin mors, "death", and mordere, meaning "to bite" (or its French derivative mordre); this would appear to be associated with the name of Lord Voldemort's followers, the Death Eaters. The English murder might also contribute.
    Notes: A possible translation might be "take a bite out of death", a fitting phrase for Death Eaters.

Mucus ad Nauseam (Curse of the Bogies)

Used in 1998 when Harry was in the passage beneath the Whomping Willow which leads to the Shrieking Shack. Lumos's power can be arranged so that a powerful wizard can make the charm illuminate intensely or to the wizards liking by loudness of incantation. For example "LUMOS!!!" would be powerful and "lumos" would be weaker. Also used by Harry Potter in 1998 to turn off the light so he could hide the Marauder's Map from Severus Snape.

Obliviate (Memory Charm)
Obliviate backfire

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: oh-BLI-vee-ate
    Description: Erases specific memories.
    Seen/Mentioned: First seen in 1993 when used by Gilderoy Lockhart on Harry and Ron; the spell backfired due to a faulty wand, costing Lockhart most of his own memory. Also, Hermione Granger used this spell to wipe her parents memories in 1997. Again, it was used in 1997 when Hermione Granger used the spell on 2 Death Eaters who had followed Harry, Ron, and Hermione after their escape from Bill Weasley's and Fleur Delacour's wedding.
    Etymology: Latin oblivisci, "forget". The spell is most often used against Muggles who have seen something of the Wizarding world.
    Notes: Invented by Mnemone Radford, who became the Ministry's first Obliviator. The Ministry of Magic employees assigned to modifying the memories of Muggles are called Obliviators. The charm can be broken by powerful magic, or extreme duress, as Lord Voldemort was able to torture Bertha Jorkins into remembering details that Barty Crouch Snr had forced her to forget using the charm. In this case, it was also shown that if the charm is too powerful, it can cause the target to develop a bad memory. This spell differs from the False memory charm.

    Description: Blindfolds the target.

    Description: Gives the victim fiery hot breath.

    Type: Charm
    Description: Sticks objects permanently in place.
    Seen/Mentioned: First mentioned in 1995, when Sirius Black suspected that his mother's painting was fixed to the wall with such a Charm. It is implied that the portrait in the Muggle Prime Minister's office also has such a charm on it.
    Notes: It is never said whether the charm prevents the object from being removed by cutting away the section of wall. The incantation could be gluten sempra, meaning glue forever, or adher sempra, which means stick forever.

    Description: Makes the caster's wand point due north.
    Seen/Mentioned: Hermione Granger taught it to Harry Potter, who used it during the Triwizard Tournament, particularly to navigate the hedge maze during the Third Task.
    Note: This spell may be an invention of Hermione Granger. Given that the incantation is English (whereas almost all other mentioned spells have incantations based on Latin or other old languages) and that none of the other champions of the Tournament seem to use the spell, it seems likely that Hermione invented the spell.

Portus

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: POR-tus
    Description: Turns an object into a portkey.
    Seen/Mentioned: Used by Albus Dumbledore in 1996.
    Etymology: Latin porta, meaning "gate", or portare, meaning "to carry" (as in to carry the caster or target to another location). There is a Latin word portus, meaning "harbour", but it is inappropriate in this context.
    Notes: Portkeys were first seen in 1994 as a means for Harry, Hermione, and the Weasleys to go to the Quidditch World Cup. However, the spell used in its creation was not seen until 1995.

Prior Incantato (Reverse Spell)
Priori Incantatem Pottermore

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: pri-OR in-can-TAH-toh
    Description: Forces a wand to show an "echo" of the last spell it performed.
    Seen/Mentioned: Used by Amos Diggory in 1994 to discover the last spell cast by Harry's wand after it was found in the hands of Winky, a house-elf.
    Etymology: Latin prior, "previous", and incantare, "to speak a spell" (past participle incantatum).
    Notes: Can manifest in the form of the Reverse Spell effect, or Priori Incantatem, when wands with the same core attempt to do battle.
    Notes (2): Apparently the spell is cumulative, with the user able to go further back and see spells that the wand performed after the latest spell. Harry suggests this in 1997. Hermione does not contradict his claim, suggesting this is true.

(Protean Charm)
EnchantedCoin

    Type: Charm
    Description: Causes copies of an object to be remotely affected by changes made to the original.
    Seen/Mentioned: First used in 1995. Hermione Granger put the charm on a number of fake Galleons. Instead of the serial number around the edge of the coin, the time and date of the next meeting of Dumbledore's Army appeared. It is possible that this charm is used on the Death Eaters' Dark Marks.
    Etymology: The English word Protean derives from Proteus, a god in Greek Mythology. Proteus was a shape-shifter, able to take many forms. As a result, the word Protean has come to refer to versatility, flexibility, or an ability to assume many forms. "Protean" is also similar to "protein", derived from the same root, meaning a variable, flexible substance which forms strong bonds between its constituent parts.
    Notes: On Hermione's fake galleons, when the date changes, the coin becomes hot, alerting the owner to look at the coin. This may not be a feature of the original charm. It may be a Flagrante Curse, when the Protean Charm changes the coin the curse may activate. It would seem from this that you can decide what the effects on the charmed objects are. Possibly by saying something along the lines of "Protean flagrante." although this is just speculation.
    Notes (2): The Protean Charm is a N.E.W.T. standard charm, according to Terry Boot, who is incredulous that Hermione can perform the spell even though she is only in her fifth year (N.E.W.T.s are taken in the seventh year at Hogwarts).

    Description: Invisible shield that reflects spells and blocks physical entities.
    Seen/Mentioned: First seen in 1995, in which Harry is taught this spell by Hermione in preparation for the third task in the Triwizard Tournament. Albus Dumbledore uses a similar spell which reverses the construction of glass back into sand when Voldemort sent shards of glass to try to stab Dumbledore. Fred and George Weasley enchanted hats they dubbed "shield hats" with this spell in 1997.
    Etymology: Latin protego, "I cover" or "I protect".
    Notes: The original description of this spell states that it rebounds minor jinxes to the caster. However, it is shown that it can also be used to reflect or lessen the effects of more powerful spells, depending on the skill of the caster. In 1998, it is also shown to be able to create a sort of force-field across an area, and is used frequently to prevent two participants in an argument from reaching each other.

    Seen/Mentioned: In 1997, Harry Potter, after checking his Blackthorn wand on the Bluebell Flames with Engorgio, casts this spell to shorten the formerly enlarged flames.
    Etymology: English reduce, "to shrink". (Latin has a verb reducere, present tense reduco. This is the source of the English "reduce", but has a different meaning.) Also in Italian Riduco first person present tense of Ridurre, same root of Latin Reducere.
    Notes: Whether Reducio could also be used by itself rather than countering Engorgio is unknown. If it could, it would shrink normal sized items into miniature versions of themselves. References in 1992 by Arthur Weasley to "shrinking door keys" make this seem likely.

Reducto (Reductor Curse)
OOTP DA Ginny Reducto

    Type: Curse
    Pronunciation: re-DUK-toh
    Description: Breaks objects. In stronger usages, disintegrates them.
    Seen/Mentioned: In 1995, Harry used it on one of the hedges of the Triwizard maze and ends up burning a small hole in it; in 1995, Gryffindors in Harry Potter's year referenced Parvati Patil as being able to reduce a table full of Dark Detectors to ashes, and Harry and his friends later used the spell in the Department of Mysteries against the Death Eaters, shattering many Prophecy Orbs in the process; in 1997, a member of the Order of the Phoenix attempted to use this spell to break down a door which Death Eaters had blocked when the Death Eaters had cornered Dumbledore in the Lightning Struck Tower.

Reverte

    Type: Charm

    Seen/Mentioned: In 1927, Leta Lestrange used this spell on the record towers in the French Ministry of Magic Records Room at the French Ministry of Magic Headquarters, in an attempt to flee from pursuing Matagots. This sent all the record towers - previously summoned by Lestrange - flying backwards and spinning back into their original positions in the ground.
    Etymology: Reverte is derived from Latin for "you shall return", being a second-person imperative form (singular, present, active) of the verb reverto ("I return, or turn back").

Relashio being used against Grindylows

    Type: Jinx
    Pronunciation: ruh-LASH-ee-oh
    Description: Forces the target to release its grip on whatever it is holding.
    Seen/Mentioned: Used by Harry Potter against Grindylows in the second task of the Triwizard Tournament. Also used in 1997 and 1998, when Hermione used this spell to free Mary Cattermole from the chained chair and to free the Ukrainian Ironbelly on which they were to get out from Gringotts.
    Etymology: Probably from the French verb relâcher ="to release, to set free", or Italian rilascio (pronounced the same way as the spell)= "I release".

Rennervate (Reviving Spell)
Revive Charm WU

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: RENN-a-vate
    Description: Awakens an unconscious victim. It is consequently the counter-charm to the Stunning Spell.

Reparo (Mending Charm)
Reparo

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: reh-PAH-roh
    Description: Seamlessly repairs broken objects.
    Seen/Mentioned: Used by Albus Dumbledore and Horace Slughorn to repair damage the latter had done to a Muggle home in Budleigh Babberton where he had been hiding. It was also used by Harry Potter to repair his wand with the Elder Wand
    Etymology: Latin reparo meaning "to renew" or "repair".[62]
    Notes: Reparo has been seen to repair non-magical items, however it seems to have an inability at repairing magical items or items that have magic placed upon them. An example is Harry's Nimbus 2000 shown in 1993 which he is told is irreparable after it is destroyed by the Whomping Willow. Wands are also irreparable, as shown in 1992 when Ron's wand snapped after he and Harry crashed onto the Hogwarts grounds. Despite his use of Spellotape, Ron's wand malfunctioned throughout the year. Another example is in 1997 when Hermione tried to fix Harry's broken wand, which was snapped by her errant Blasting Curse. However, Harry repaired his wand with the Elder Wand. Since the Elder Wand is the most powerful wand in creation, it makes sense that it would produce the most powerful Mending Charm.

    Seen/Mentioned: It was used to keep Muggles away from the Quidditch World Cup. Hogwarts was also said to be guarded by the Muggle-Repelling Charm. It was also used by Harry and Hermione on numerous occasions, among many other spells, to protect and hide their camp site in 1997.

Repello Inimicum
DesintegrateSnatcher

Snatchers being desintegrated by the power of this spell combined with other protections

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: re-PEH-lloh ee-nee-MEE-cum

    Seen/Mentioned: This spell was used by professors Filius Flitwick and Horace Slughorn along with Order of the Phoenix member Molly Weasley to protect Hogwarts Castle in 1998.

Rictusempra (Tickling Charm)
Rictusempra

Harry Potter in the Duelling Club using Rictusempra

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: ric-tuhs-SEM-pra
    Description: Tickles the target until they become weak with laughter.[40]
    Seen/Mentioned: By Harry Potter on Draco Malfoy in 1992, when they fought in the Duelling Club.[40]
    Etymology: Possibly the sum of two words; The Latin rictus, meaning "The expanse of an open mouth", and semper, meaning "Always". Rictus is generally used as an expression of terror, however, "always an open mouth" would, in most cases, correspond to the act of laughing uncontrollably.

Riddikulus (Boggart Banishing Spell)
Neville Riddikulus

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: rih-dih-KUL-lus
    Description: A spell used when fighting a Boggart, "Riddikulus" forces the Boggart to take the appearance of an object the caster is focusing on. Best results can be achieved if the caster is focusing on something humorous, with the desire that laughter will weaken the Boggart.[63]
    Seen/Mentioned: Taught by Remus Lupin during third year Defence Against the Dark Arts, where his students had the opportunity to practise the spell on an actual Boggart.[63]
    Etymology: Latin word ridiculus, "laughable" (but perhaps "absurd" or "silly" in this context).
    Notes: The effect of the spell seems to rely primarily on the state of mind of the caster. It doesn't actually change the shape of a boggart into something humorous, but rather whatever the caster is concentrating on at the moment of the casting, as when Neville was thinking of his grandmother's dress. Presumably, Mrs Weasley couldn't take her mind off of her fears for her family, so the Boggart was changed into other members of the family rather than something humorous.


Salvio hexia
SalvioHexia

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: SAL-vee-oh HECKS-ee-ah
    Description: Protects against hexes.
    Etymology: Possibly derived from the Latin "salveo," meaning "to be in good health," and used as a form of greeting and farewell, and a pseudo-Latin derivative of the English word "hex"—hence, "Farewell, hexes!"
    Seen/Mentioned: Harry and Hermione cast this spell to strengthen their camp-site's defences against intruders in 1997.
    Notes: Possibly the Hex Deflection spells the fake Moody mentioned in 1994.

Scourgify (Scouring Charm)
HM y4 Scourgify

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: SKUR-ji-fy
    Description: Cleans objects
    Seen/Mentioned: First used by Nymphadora Tonks to clean Hedwig's cage in 1995. Later, Ginny Weasley performed the spell to clean up the Stinksap on the Hogwarts Express, also used by James Potter on Severus Snape after he shouted various curses and obscenities at him.
    Etymology: Perhaps related to English scour, "clean". -ify is a common English suffix meaning "to make ...". Therefore scourgify could mean "to make clean".


Sectumsempra
Sectumempra Curse

    Type: Curse
    Pronunciation: sec-tum-SEMP-rah
    Description: Lacerates the target, as if they have been "slashed by a sword." Subsequently, the target can easily bleed to death from the wounds.[58] This curse was invented by Severus Snape, to be used against his personal enemies.[5]
    Seen/Mentioned: Used by Harry in 1997 against Draco Malfoy,[58] and then later against both the Inferi in Lord Voldemort's Horcrux cave,[4] and Snape used it against George Weasley (was unintentional; aimed for a Death Eater that tried to curse Lupin) in the Order's flight from Privet Drive. Harry learned it in Snape's old Potions textbook. In 1998, the spell is said to be Severus Snape's "signature" spell.
    Etymology: Latin sectum, "cut", and semper, "always".
    Notes: The spell can apparently be used against any object, but was not effective when used against Inferi because they could not feel pain or bleed. The movement of the wand seems to affect how someone is cut, suggested by the erratic patterns of slashes left on Draco Malfoy's face and chest, produced by Harry Potter's wild wand-swings while using the spell against Draco. Wounds caused by this spell can be healed as proved by Severus Snape who after Harry hit Draco Malfoy with this spell he healed Draco's wounds and told him to go and get treated with dittany at once so that he would even avoid any sign of any wound. However it seems that it depends on the caster's magical abilities because Molly Weasley could not heal and restore George Weasley's ear that was cursed off by this spell.

Shield Penetration

    Type: Spell
    Pronunciation: unknown
    Description: Annihilates magical enchantments and shields.

    Seen/Mentioned: Used by Draco Malfoy while duelling Harry Potter in 1992.

Silencio (Silencing Charm)
Silencio

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: sih-LEN-see-oh
    Description: Makes something silent.
    Seen/Mentioned: First used by Hermione in 1996 to silence a frog and a raven in Charms class, then later used to silence a Death Eater that was trying to tell his comrades where they were.

    Type: Curse
    Description: Forces the victim to burp up slimy slugs.
    Seen/Mentioned: In 1992, Ronald Weasley attempted to curse Draco Malfoy with this spell after the latter insulted Hermione Granger, but was unsuccessful as his wand at the time was broken, and thus his curse backfired on himself.[64]

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: soh-NOHR-uhs

    Seen/Mentioned: Used by Hermione Granger to find out more of Harry's Advanced Potion-Making book in 1996. Used by Ernie Macmillan to find out ingredients of a potion.
    Etymology: Latin specialis, "particular;individual" and revelare (present tense revelo), "unveil".
    Notes: In 1994, Severus Snape cast a similar spell, but with different words ("Reveal your secrets!"), on the Marauder's Map, though he may have just been saying those words as he cast the spell non-verbally.



Sternius
Steleus

    Type: Dark charm
    Pronunciation: STEH-lee-us, or perhaps STEH-nee-us
    Description: A spell that causes the victim to sneeze for a short period of time. This spell is used in duelling to distract the opponent.
    Etymology: Sternius derives from the Latin sternuo, meaning I sneeze.


Stupefy (Stunning Spell)
DH1 Harry as Albert Runcorn stunning Umbridge

    Type: Charm
    Pronunciation: STOO-puh-fye
    Description: Stuns the target, rendering them unconscious.
    Seen/Mentioned: Often; particularly by a number of wizards and witches (including Dolores Umbridge) against Minerva McGonagall in 1996. It's also taught by Harry in his D.A. meetings.
    Etymology: English stupefy, which means 'to put into a stupor', a temporary vegetative state.
    Notes: The physical manifestation of the spell is a beam of red light emanating from the caster's wand. The spell wears off after a short time, and can be countered by Rennervate. Nearly useless on magic-resistant creatures such as dragons, trolls and giants unless more than one Stupefy spell is used at the same time. The force of the spell is additive or perhaps even exponential, and it can cause severe injury if many spells are used on a target that is not normally resistant to its effects. Hagrid, as a half-giant, was impervious to this spell - or at least, a lone one.

Surgito (Disenchantment Charm)
Surgito

    Type: Counter-charm
    Pronunciation: SUR-jee-toh
    Description: Counter-charm that can be used to remove enchantments.
    Seen/Mentioned: In 1927, Newton Scamander used Surgito to lift an enchantment that was placed on Jacob Kowalski. As a result of the spell, Kowalski awoke from the dreamlike enchanted state, and regained an awareness of reality in the present.
    Etymology: Surgito is a Latin word in the imperative form meaning "you/he/she shall arise, or get up", and is a conjugation of the verb surgo ("I arise"). The etymology is appropriate, considering that the effects of the spell on Jacob Kowalski can be likened to waking up from a confused, dreamlike state.

Goshtail

    Type: Hex
    Description: Causes the victim to grow a tail.
    Seen/Mentioned: When Miranda Goshawk had her Book of Spells printed, she gave copies to her sisters that had various misprints in them; one such misprint somehow gave her sister Romilda a tail.[16] Timothy Blenkinsop was hit with this hex when he was caught in the crossfire of a Puddlemere United vs. Holyhead Harpies riot.
